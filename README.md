# SQL_Project_Music_Store_Analysis
SQL project to analyze online music store data

Summary:
This project focuses on analyzing a music store's data to extract key business insights using SQL. The analysis is divided into three sets of queries:

Easy Queries: Identifying the senior-most employee, countries with the most invoices, top invoice values, cities with the highest revenue, and the best customer by spending.

Moderate Queries: Analyzing rock music listeners, top rock bands by track count, and identifying tracks longer than the average song length.

Advanced Queries: Calculating customer spending by artist, determining the most popular music genre by country, and finding the top-spending customers per country.

This analysis helps uncover customer behavior, popular music preferences, and top revenue-generating cities and customers.
